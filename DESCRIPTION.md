The main characteristics of a Lean-Coffee-based meeting are the dynamically built agenda and the discussion time limits.

This powerup offers:
- **voting** and sorting of cards based on votes
- a configurable **timer** on the back of every card
- **badges** showing the amount of time spent discussing a topic
- a UI to let board members vote, when the timer expires, to decide whether to switch topic or keep going
